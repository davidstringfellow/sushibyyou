# sushibyyou

Sushi By You is a personal project that will allow users to share Sushi that they made or had at a restaurant.  Eventually there will be features like geolocation, likes, and even review.

It looks pretty ugly right now.  Its in its early stages and I'm focusing on functionality and formulating ideas.

The project is currently written in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).  

**To do**
- upgrade Firebase and refactor login
- add additional login methods (e.g., Google, Facebook)
- web navigation / deep linking
