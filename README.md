# sushibyyou

Sushi By You is a personal project that will allow users to share Sushi that they made or had at a restaurant.  Eventually there will be features like geolocation, likes, and even review.

The project is currently written in [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
